Buffer-oriented UTF codec primitives and Unicode/ASCII support utilities for Rust.

## Overview

Qubit Text Codec is a low-level codec core for Rust code that needs explicit control below ordinary `str`, `String`, and `char` APIs. Its current built-in codecs focus on Unicode transfer formats: UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, with both code-unit and byte-oriented variants where that distinction matters.

The crate also provides the small shared surface that codec adapters need: encoding identity metadata, encoder/decoder traits, decode status values, byte order and BOM helpers, and concrete encoding/decoding error types. ASCII and Unicode namespace helpers are included because UTF codecs and text parsers often need these checks close to the buffer boundary.

Use this crate when you need:

- ASCII classification, case conversion, digit conversion, and ASCII folding;
- Unicode code point and scalar value checks, surrogate checks, plane calculation, and noncharacter/control classification;
- UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 namespace helpers for byte or code-unit classification and length calculation;
- buffer-level `TextEncoder<T>` and `TextDecoder<T>` implementations for UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32;
- byte-order and BOM handling for UTF-16 and UTF-32 byte streams;
- a small trait and error vocabulary that future non-Unicode encoding adapters can reuse without making this crate a text I/O framework.

Prefer Rust's standard text APIs for ordinary text handling. Use this crate when a parser, binary format, or text I/O adapter needs strict buffer-level UTF codec behavior and precise error positions.

API reference documentation is available on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/qubit-text-codec).

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
qubit-text-codec = "0.1"
```

## Quick Example

```rust
use qubit_text_codec::{
    ByteOrder,
    DecodeStatus,
    TextDecoder,
    TextEncoder,
    Unicode,
    UnicodeBom,
    Utf8,
    Utf8Decoder,
    Utf8Encoder,
    Utf16,
    Utf16ByteEncoder,
};

assert!(Unicode::is_scalar_value('中' as u32));
assert_eq!(Some(3), Utf8::byte_len_from_leading_byte(0xE4));
assert_eq!(2, Utf16::unit_len('😀'));
assert_eq!(Some(UnicodeBom::Utf8), UnicodeBom::detect(&[0xEF, 0xBB, 0xBF]));

let decoder = Utf8Decoder;
let decoded = decoder.decode_prefix("中".as_bytes())?;
assert_eq!(
    DecodeStatus::Complete {
        value: '中',
        consumed: 3,
    },
    decoded,
);

let encoder = Utf8Encoder;
let mut utf8 = [0; Utf8::MAX_BYTES_PER_CHAR];
let written = encoder.encode_char('😀', &mut utf8)?;
assert_eq!("😀".as_bytes(), &utf8[..written]);

let utf16 = Utf16ByteEncoder::new(ByteOrder::LittleEndian);
let mut bytes = [0; Utf16::MAX_BYTES_PER_CHAR];
let written = utf16.encode_char('😀', &mut bytes)?;
assert_eq!(&[0x3D, 0xD8, 0x00, 0xDE], &bytes[..written]);

# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

## Main Capabilities

### Standards

UTF-8 decoding follows the well-formed byte sequence rules in the
[Unicode Standard, Table 3-7](https://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/core-spec/chapter-3/#G7404)
and the equivalent [RFC 3629](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3629)
syntax. Malformed byte sequences include overlong encodings, UTF-8 encodings of surrogate code points, invalid continuation bytes, and sequences above `U+10FFFF`.

### Namespace Enums

`qubit-text-codec` exposes stateless namespace enums for constants, classification, conversion, and sizing. Encoding and decoding behavior lives in dedicated codec types.

| Namespace | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Ascii` | ASCII constants, classification, case conversion, digit conversion, case-insensitive comparison, and ASCII folding |
| `Unicode` | Unicode code point range checks, scalar value checks, surrogate checks, plane calculation, noncharacter checks, control checks, and `u32` to `char` conversion |
| `Utf8` | UTF-8 byte classification and byte length calculation |
| `Utf16` | UTF-16 surrogate classification, surrogate-pair composition/decomposition, code-unit length calculation, and UTF-16 BOM detection |
| `Utf32` | UTF-32 scalar unit validation, unit length calculation, and UTF-32 BOM detection |

### Codec Traits

Encoding and decoding are modeled by small traits over caller-provided buffers.

| Trait | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `TextDecoder<T>` | Decodes encoded units from `&[T]` into Unicode `char` values |
| `TextEncoder<T>` | Encodes Unicode `char` values into `&mut [T]` |
| `TextCodec<T>` | Blanket trait for types implementing both encoder and decoder for the same storage unit type |

`T` is the buffer storage unit, not always the Unicode code unit. UTF-8 uses `u8`, UTF-16 code-unit codecs use `u16`, byte-serialized UTF-16 uses `u8`, UTF-32 code-unit codecs use `u32`, and byte-serialized UTF-32 uses `u8`.

`TextEncoding` is a lightweight encoding identity descriptor with a stable `id`,
display `name`, and accepted `aliases`. Built-in descriptors are available as
`TextEncoding::ASCII`, `TextEncoding::UTF_8`, `TextEncoding::UTF_16`, and
`TextEncoding::UTF_32`. External codec crates can define their own static
descriptors, for example `TextEncoding::new("gbk", "GBK", &["cp936"])`.
Equality and hashing use only the `id`, while `matches_label` accepts the id,
display name, or aliases with ASCII case-insensitive comparison.

### Built-in Codecs

| Codec family | Storage unit | Types |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UTF-8 bytes | `u8` | `Utf8Encoder`, `Utf8Decoder`, `Utf8Codec` |
| UTF-16 code units | `u16` | `Utf16U16Encoder`, `Utf16U16Decoder`, `Utf16U16Codec` |
| UTF-16 bytes | `u8` | `Utf16ByteEncoder`, `Utf16ByteDecoder`, `Utf16ByteCodec` |
| UTF-32 code units | `u32` | `Utf32U32Encoder`, `Utf32U32Decoder`, `Utf32U32Codec` |
| UTF-32 bytes | `u8` | `Utf32ByteEncoder`, `Utf32ByteDecoder`, `Utf32ByteCodec` |

Byte codecs carry a `ByteOrder` value. Use `UnicodeBom::detect`, `Utf16::detect_bom`, or `Utf32::detect_bom` when a byte stream may include a BOM. The byte codecs do not detect, skip, or emit BOM bytes automatically. Streaming callers should buffer up to four bytes, or read until EOF, before deciding the BOM because UTF-32 little-endian (`FF FE 00 00`) overlaps the UTF-16 little-endian prefix (`FF FE`).

### Decode Status and Errors

`TextDecoder::decode_prefix` distinguishes incomplete input from malformed input:

| Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DecodeStatus::Complete { value, consumed }` | A complete scalar value and consumed unit count |
| `DecodeStatus::NeedMore { required, available }` | The prefix is valid so far but more units are required |
| `TextDecodingError` | Encoding, decoding error kind, input unit index, and optional raw value |
| `TextEncodingError` | Encoding, encoding error kind, output/input index, and optional raw value |

`DecodeStatus::NeedMore` is not an error. A streaming text reader should read more input when possible, and convert it at EOF into an incomplete-sequence error or an appropriate `std::io::Error`.

Errors tied to a raw value, such as an invalid UTF-32 unit or invalid raw code point passed to `encode_code_point`, expose that value through `value()`.

### ASCII Helpers

`Ascii` keeps ASCII-only behavior explicit and predictable:

| Method group | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Range checks | `is_ascii_byte`, `is_ascii_char`, `is_ascii_code_point` |
| Classification | `is_whitespace_byte`, `is_letter_char`, `is_digit_code_point`, `is_hex_digit_char`, `is_printable_byte`, `is_control_code_point` |
| Conversion | `byte_to_uppercase`, `char_to_lowercase`, `char_to_digit`, `code_point_to_hex_digit` |
| Comparison and folding | `equals_ignore_case_char`, `equals_ignore_case_code_point`, `fold`, `fold_to_string` |

## Prelude

`qubit_text_codec::prelude` re-exports the core namespace enums, codec traits, built-in codec types, byte-order/BOM helpers, decode-status types, and text encoding/decoding errors.

```rust
use qubit_text_codec::prelude::*;
```

## Crate Boundary

`qubit-text-codec` is not a general text processing library. It intentionally stays below grapheme-cluster segmentation, normalization, collation, locale-aware case mapping, transliteration, automatic encoding detection, display-width calculation, and `std::io` reader/writer adapters.

Its built-in codecs currently cover UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32. It does not replace `encoding_rs` for legacy or web-compatible encodings such as GBK, Big5, Shift_JIS, or Windows code pages. Future crates can add those encodings on top of the shared traits and error model, or delegate their tables and compatibility rules to specialized libraries.

Use specialized crates such as `unicode-segmentation`, `unicode-normalization`, `unicode-width`, or ICU4X for higher-level Unicode semantics.

## Dependencies

This crate uses `thiserror` for error `Display` and `Error` implementations.

## Testing & Code Coverage

This project maintains test coverage for ASCII classification and folding, Unicode code point helpers, BOM and byte-order handling, UTF-8/UTF-16/UTF-32 namespace helpers, buffer-level UTF codecs, and text encoding/decoding errors.
